# College-vs.-Non-College-Resources-Project


• Conducted a survey of 100+ students from diverse departments at CSUEB to assess perceptions of traditional (college-provided) vs. non-traditional (online like YouTube,ChatGPT) educational resources.

• Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends in resource usage and perceived effectiveness.

• Applied hypothesis testing and bootstrapping to analyze significant differences in resource effectiveness by academic level and department.

• Found that students value both resource types, with slight preference for college resources in larger samples.

• Highlighted the importance of a hybrid approach to resource availability for academic success.
